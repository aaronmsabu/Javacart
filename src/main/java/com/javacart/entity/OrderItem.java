/**
 * OrderItem represents a single line item in an order.
 * This is a snapshot of the product at the time of purchase.
 * 
 * Relationships:
 * - Many OrderItems belong to one Order (N:1)
 * - Many OrderItems reference one Product (N:1)
 * 
 * Why we store priceAtPurchase:
 * - Product prices can change over time
 * - Historical orders must show the price customer actually paid
 * - This creates an immutable record of the transaction
 * 
 * Example: If a laptop costs $1000 today and customer buys it,
 * even if we raise the price to $1200 tomorrow, their order
 * history will still show they paid $1000.
 * 
 * Cascade vs No Cascade on Product:
 * - We DON'T cascade delete from Product to OrderItem
 * - If a product is deleted from catalog, orders remain intact
 * - This preserves historical purchase records
