/**
 * CartItem represents a single product in a user's shopping cart.
 * 
 * Relationships:
 * - Many CartItems belong to one User (N:1)
 * - Many CartItems reference one Product (N:1)
 * 
 * Business Logic:
 * - Each user can have only ONE cart item per product (enforced by unique constraint)
 * - Quantity can be updated (increase/decrease)
 * - Cart items are temporary - they're cleared after successful checkout
 * - If user deletes their account, cart items are also deleted (CASCADE)
 * 
 * Fetch Strategy:
 * - User and Product use EAGER fetch because we almost always need these details
 *   when displaying the cart (to show product names, prices, etc.)
 * - Alternative: Use LAZY + explicit JOIN FETCH in queries for better performance
